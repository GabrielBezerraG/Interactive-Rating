# Interactive Rating Component
This is a solution to the [Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## My Process
I built this simple page with react just like on the previous challenges. I used state in the main component to save the chosen rating number, styling the corresponding button and render a thank you message after the rating number is submitted. I tried to finish this project as quickly as I could to keep improving my coding speed.
